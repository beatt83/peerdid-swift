/** This code provides "varint" encoding of 64-bit integers.
    It is based on the Go implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers
    varint specification.

    Varints are a method of serializing integers using one or more bytes.
    Smaller numbers take a smaller number of bytes.
    For more details see ipfs/QmXJXJMai4p88HMsp2TPP1EtZxfSZQ1vyRtN5dGKvQ6MCw

    The encoding is:
    -   Unsigned integers are serialized 7 bits at a time, starting with the
        least significant bits.

    -   The most significant bit (msb) in each output byte indicates if there
        is a continuation byte.

    -   Signed integers are mapped to unsigned integers using "zig-zag" encoding:
        Positive values x are written as 2*x + 0,
        Negative values x are written as 2*(~x) + 1
        So, negative values are complemented and whether to complement is encoded
        in bit 0.
